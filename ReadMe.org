** Description

This project involves creating an LLVM pass that uses dataflow
analysis to compute anticipated expressions. Based on this
information, the pass performs code hoisting to minimize code size and
avoid repeated evaluation of expressions. The implementation will be
validated by checking whether anticipated expressions have been
successfully removed from the IR.
